# NodeHTTP

**NodeHTTP** is a personal project developed to learn and understand the core concepts of Node.js and HTTP servers. The project demonstrates how to create an HTTP server using Node.js, handle routing, and build simple web functionalities. This project serves as a foundation for exploring backend development using JavaScript and HTTP protocols.

## Features

- **Factorial Calculation**: A feature that calculates the factorial of a given number.
- **Prime Number Checker**: A feature that checks if a given number is prime.
- **Fibonacci Series**: A feature that generates the Fibonacci series up to a given number.
- **Basic Calculator**: A simple calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used to create the server and handle requests.
- **HTTP Module**: The built-in Node.js HTTP module is used to create the server and handle routing based on user requests.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for building and styling the front-end of the application to make it user-friendly.

## Purpose

This project was created to:
- Learn how to build an HTTP server in Node.js.
- Understand basic concepts like request handling, query parameters, and routing.
- Practice building a simple web application using pure Node.js without any frameworks.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can visit the following URLs:
- Home: Displays the main page with links to different features.
- /prime: Check if a number is prime.
- /factorial: Calculate the factorial of a number.
- /fibonacci: Generate the Fibonacci series for a given number.
- /calculator: Use the basic calculator for arithmetic operations.
